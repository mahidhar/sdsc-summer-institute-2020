### Overview

Wednesday afternoon of the Summer Institute, we will be holding a Lightning Round. This is a
longstanding tradition where all participants are asked to present two slides describing (1) their
work or research and (2) their computational challenges and what they hope to accomplish
from attending the Summer Institute.
Download [`template.ppt`](https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2020/blob/master/3.2_Lightning_round/template.ppt) and edit it with Powerpoint or Google Docs.

Feel free to alter the slides in any way you see fit using your choice of figures, text, fonts, etc.
We just ask that you limit yourself to two slides and make sure that your name and institution
appear on both slides. Each participant will be limited to four minutes, so please consider
rehearsing before the Lightning Round. Finally, keep in mind that the Summer Institute
participants come from many different backgrounds, so tailor your content for non-specialists.
